This repo contains my solutions to ACM programming contest problems hosted at
POJ (http://acm.pku.edu.cn/JudgeOnline/). You can check my profile on POJ at
http://acm.pku.edu.cn/JudgeOnline/userstatus?user_id=cmb2. I use POJ to study
algorithms and sharpen my programming skill. I believe 

"Having a solid base of algorithmic knowledge and technique is one
characteristic that separates the truly skilled programmers from the novices."

Problems are organized using their problem ID. All files about Problem X are
placed in folder 'X', and the description of the Problem X can be found at
http://acm.pku.edu.cn/JudgeOnline/problem?id=X.
